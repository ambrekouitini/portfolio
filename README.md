# Deployment & Extensions :
The deployment of the site was done with Vercel App.
To make a powerful and efficient site I installed the codefactor and codacy applications.
Codefactor serves to performs Code Review with every GitHub Commit or PR. Zero setup time. Get actionable feedback within seconds. Customize rules, get refactoring tips and ignore irrelevant issues.
Codacy is an automated code analysis/quality tool that helps developers ship better software, faster. With Codacy, you get static analysis, cyclomatic complexity, duplication and code unit test coverage changes in every commit and pull request
